### Description

This is a simple game that a beginner could learn from. There are no api calls in it. It is all pure visual basic code. The collision detection is not 100% perfect but works pretty well. All of this code is 100% from me and none was taken from PSC or any other source. Feel free to make NICE comments and vote if you like it. Hope you all enjoy it!!
